## How To Use Vista!🚠
To get a general idea of how to use Vista, start with `/vista`, which has buttons that send ephemeral responses, and includes the most commonly used commands. 

## Rules Lookup!🧑‍⚖️ 
Use `/rules` to lookup rules for the Horizon Framework. `/rules` has the following subcommands. 
<br>
<br>
• `/rules attributes` details what each attribute represents in Horizon. <br>
• `/rules standard_roll` details how to make a Standard Roll in Horizon. <br>
• `/rules contested_roll` details how Contested Rolls work in Horizon. <br>
• `/rules group_roll` details how Group Rolls work in Horizon. <br>
• `/rules fortune` details the *Fortune* resource, and what it's used for in Horizon. <br>
• `/rules modifiers` details Contextual and Eternal modifiers, along with the lowest and maximum dice that can be rolled. <br>
• `/rules catchphrase` details why players should say their catchphrase. <br>
• `/rules connections` details bonds and owing favours (Owes Me One) in Horizon. <br>
• `/rules spaces` details how distance works (measured in meters). <br>
• `/rules life` details Get A Life and Hurt. <br>
• `/rules dodge` details how to avoid Hurt. <br>
• `/rules order` details what happens when Order is declared. <br>
• `/rules player_advancement` details Tiers, Ability Points, and how players progress. <br>
• `/rules protection` details armor/Protective Gear. <br>
• `/rules object_life` details how much Life objects have based on their size. <br>
• `/rules intoxication` details how using intoxicants in Horizon works. <br>
• `/rules currency` details Cost & Worth (Currency). <br>
• `/rules tools_crafting_repair` details how to repair and craft items. <br>
• `/rules stuff` details how general items work. <br>
• `/rules light` details how light-emitting objects work. <br>

## Roll Dice! 🎲
Use `/roll` to roll dice. `/roll` has the following subcommands. 
<br>
<br>
• `/roll d6` lets users roll 1-10 D6s. This command has one required field called *amount*, which is where the user places the number of D6s they wish to roll. If a non-integer or number greater than 10 is placed in *amount*, Vista will respond with an error. <br>
• `/roll d100` lets users roll 1-10 D100s. Like `/roll D6`, this command has one required field called *amount*, and sends an error if a non-integer or number greater than 10 is inputed. <br>
• `/roll ability` lets users roll on the Ability table to get a random ability. <br>
• `/roll aspect` lets users generate a random NPC Aspect on the Aspect table. <br>

## Talents 🪩
Use `/talents` to detail Talent options based on Tier. This command has five subcommands. 
<br>
<br>
• `/talents first_tier` <br>
• `/talents second_tier` <br>
• `/talents third_tier` <br>
• `/talents fourth_tier` <br>
• `/talents fifth_tier` <br>

## Roles 📋
Use `/roles` to detail Role options for players. 

## Phases 🎭
`/phases` is a group command that details the standard options available when Order is declared. `/phases` has two subcommands. 
<br>
<br>
• `/phases act` details the options for the Act phase. <br>
• `/phases move` details the options for the Move phase. <br>

## Hazards ☢️
Use `/hazards` to detail different hazards in Horizon. This command—along with `/pets` and `/echo`—are not attached to `/rules` because of the limit of 25 subcommands the Discord API has. 

## Pets 🐶
Use `/pets` to detail Pets in Horizon. 

## Echo 🗣️
Use `/echo` to detail the Echo optional rule.
