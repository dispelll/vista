## How To Use Vista!🚠
To get a general idea of how to use Vista, start with `/vista`, which has buttons that send ephemeral responses, and includes the most commonly used commands. 

## Rules Lookup!🧑‍⚖️

## Roll Dice! 🎲
Use `/roll` to roll dice. `/roll` has the following subcommands. 
<br>
<br>
• `/roll d6` lets users roll 1-10 D6s. This command has one required field called *amount*, which is where the user places the number of D6s they wish to roll. If a non-integer or number greater than 10 is placed in *amount*, Vista will respond with an error. <br>
• `/roll d100` lets users roll 1-10 D100s. Like `/roll D6`, this command has one required field called *amount*, and sends an error if a non-integer or number greater than 10 is inputed. <br>
• `/roll ability` lets users roll on the Ability table to get a random ability. <br>
• `/roll aspect` lets users generate a random NPC Aspect on the Aspect table. <br>

## Talents 🪩
Use `/talents` to detail Talent options based on Tier. This command has five subcommands. 
<br>
<br>
• `/talents first_tier` <br>
• `/talents second_tier` <br>
• `/talents third_tier` <br>
• `/talents fourth_tier` <br>
• `/talents fifth_tier` <br>

## Roles 📋
Use `/roles` to detail Role options for players. 

## Phases 🎭
`/phases` is a group command that details the standard options available when Order is declared. `/phases` has two subcommands. 
<br>
<br>
• `/phases act` details the options for the Act phase. <br>
• `/phases move` details the options for the Move phase. <br>

## Hazards ☢️
Use `/hazards` to detail different hazards in Horizon. This command—along with `/pets` and `/echo`—are not attached to `/rules` because of the limit of 25 subcommands the Discord API has. 

## Pets 🐶
Use `/pets` to detail Pets in Horizon. 

## Echo 🗣️
Use `/echo` to detail the Echo optional rule. 

## Add Your Horizon Content! 📚
Want to add your Horizon game or module to Vista? [Email us!](mailto:horizon.framework@gmail.com) Your content will remain solely yours, should you add it to the bot, and will **not** be added as part of it's open source code. 

## Coming Soon!
We plan to implement the following new features.
<br>
<br>
• `/generate` will be a new group command with two subcommands: `/character`, which will generate a random Horizon character and populate an attached character sheet; `/npc`, which will generate a random NPC, and populate an attached NPC sheet. <br>
• The `/order` subcommand will be added to `/roll`, and will allow users to roll Order and keep track of turns.
